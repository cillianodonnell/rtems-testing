This directory contains scripts which assist in running Coverity
on RTEMS and submitting them to the Coverity builder.  You have
to have an account to view the results of the run.  

NOTE: Please edit the script to change the email address. :)

Coverity is a closed source static code analyser which can detect a variety
of programming errors.

STATUS
======
+ These scripts have a number of hard-coded variables that should probably
  be passed in on the command line.

+ There are likely errors it does not detect.  So far, it looks like
  a lot can go wrong. :)

+ I do not know how to grab the information on a Coverity issue and
  bring it to the community in a way that is nice yet.  

+ We need to decide whether to scan BSPs and tests.
